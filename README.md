# Q1Proposal

There will be two proposals. 

1) A website where people could calculate their bonds. They would insert the numbers given about the bond such as coupon rate, semi-annually/annual payment/monthly payments, whether the bond is 100/1000 USD,
   when it matures (Yield to Maturity). Afterwards, using that information, it would automatically calculates the risk of the bond. I want to include a page that talks about which bond the people should
   focus on based on their risk tolerance, but there are a few legal aspects I have to look into.

2) The second one is for those who is travelling to Australia for the first time. Usually, there isnt a page that includes all the common Imperial to Metric conversions. Hence, everything would be under 
  one page and it is more convenient. I would also include all the common slangs, time difference, and the exchange rate between USD and AUD. I am going to add API for the exchange rate so it will 
  constantly update itself rather than me doing it manually on a daily basis. I am thinking of introducing a story line to make the website more attractive. This website is targeting younger people, 
  Americans who are curious about Australia and prefers everything under one umbrella.
